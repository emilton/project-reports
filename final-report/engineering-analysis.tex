\chapter{Engineering Analysis}

Once design alternatives were evaluated and the anticipated project implementation specifics were chosen, the team set out to professionally implement the design.
This entails carefully designing each of the project's components, including the hardware design, software design, and packaging design.
Thorough design ensured that implementation issues were anticipated and therefore mitigated or avoided.

\section{Design Performance}
The product performs as expected.
All of the objectives were met.
When a mill is combined with a \gls{ceenc}, the mill correctly mills a design in a timely fashion. 
The general purpose outputs work correctly.
The system can drive four stepper motors, one DC motor, and receives input from an emergency stop switch and 4 stepper home inputs.
The g code used to execute commands can be sent over \gls{tcpip}.
The steppers are driven at a frequency range of at least 10kHz within 5\% accuracy.
The whole system can handle a variety of power supplies and draws no more than 10 amps.
The thermal shutdown also is triggered when the system reaches $60^{\circ}C$.
