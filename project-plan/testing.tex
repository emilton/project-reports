\chapter{Testing}
Validation and verification prove to all stakeholders that the goals of the project have been met.
Thorough testing throughout the entire project is vital to identifying potential issues and correcting them before a final product is created. 
Validation was completed by comparing the engineering requirements with the marketing requirements that were discussed by the team. 

The following 10 items are the success criteria for the project. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a complete \gls{bom} and order/sample all parts needed for the design.
	\item Develop complete, accurate, readable schematic of the design, complete with interface loading analysis and interface timing analysis. 
	\item Complete a layout and etch a \gls{pcb}.
	\item Populate and debug the design on a custom \gls{pcb}.
	\item Professionally package the finished product and demonstrate its functionality.
	\item Stepper motor frequency capable of at least 11kHz, accurate within $\pm5\%$ of desired frequency.
	\item Receive G-code through \gls{tcpip}.
	\item Accept between 14V and 36V and draw no more than 11A.
	\item Drive at least 4 stepper motors, 1 DC motor, and 16 GPIO. Receive input from at least 1 motor limit/emergency stop switch and 4 stepper motor home inputs.
	\item Thermal shutdown will occur above CPU temperatures of $60^{\circ}C$.
\end{enumerate}
