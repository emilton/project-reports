\chapter{Engineering Requirements Specification}

\section{Five Project Common Success Criteria}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a complete \gls{bom} and order/sample all parts needed for the design.
	\item Develop complete, accurate, readable schematic of the design, complete with interface loading analysis and interface timing analysis. 
	\item Complete a layout and etch a \gls{pcb}.
	\item Populate and debug the design on a custom \gls{pcb}.
	\item Professionally package the finished product and demonstrate its functionality.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Five Project Specific Success Criteria}\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system will drive at least 4 stepper motors, 1 DC motor, and 16 \gls{gpio}.
The system will receive inputs from at least 1 motor limit/emergency stop switch and 4 stepper motor home inputs.
	\item The system will Receive G-code through \gls{tcpip}.
The system’s software will be developed using IEEE Std 830-1998 Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
	\item The maximum step frequency will be at least 10kHz.
The target step frequency will be within 5\% of the desired frequency.
	\item The system power supply will accept between 14V and 36V and draw a maximum of 10A.
	\item The system will enter thermal shutdown above CPU temperatures of $60^{\circ}C$ and the motors will cease to operate.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements Validation}
Table ~\ref{table:Val} shows the relationship between the engineering requirements and the marketing requirements.
For a marketing requirement to be validated, the respective engineering requirements must be verified.
